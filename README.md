# About Me 
Hi, I'm Alberto Cotumaccio from Rome, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at La Sapienza University. During my Bachelor's degree, I completed an internship at Pedevilla Spa, where I developed an internal web application. I later worked with them as a full-stack developer to improve the application. I have always been interested in self-improvement and making a positive impact. One of my earliest experiences was founding and managing one of the most popular Minecraft servers in Italy, which helped me to build a strong community and develop my soft skills and in server management using the CentOS operating system. Recently, I collaborated with musicians to compose music for their songs on platforms like YouTube and Spotify. I enjoy collaborating with others and exchanging ideas in my work. For me, the human element of a project is just as important as the technical side, and working with others often leads to innovative and exciting ideas that I might not have come up with on my own.

# My Technology Stack
In my experience, I've had the opportunity to work with a wide range of technologies across multiple projects, and I'm always eager to learn more: 
- On the mobile development side, I've worked with Flutter and React Native (expo), both of which have been great opportunities for creating responsive and dynamic mobile applications. 
- On the server-side, I've utilized AWS, Docker, Nginx, and Linux to create scalable and reliable infrastructure for my applications. 
- For web development, I've utilized Bootstrap, CSS3, Django, Flask, HTML5, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, React to create beautiful and efficient web applications. 
- I have experience with Solidity, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python for various programming projects. 
- I've also worked with a range of data analysis tools such as OpenCV, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn to analyze and visualize data.
- I've utilized Git for version control, Figma and Marvel for design and prototyping.
- I've also explored various design and video editing tools, such as Photoshop and Sony Vegas.
